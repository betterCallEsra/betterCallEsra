## 🐈 outside of coding

when i’m not writing code, i’m probably:

- 🎨 experimenting with graphic design
- ✍️ content writing
- 🎮 gaming 
- 🐾 hanging out with cats

## 📝 projects

okay here’s the deal:  
I *have* actually worked on two full-stack projects —  
- one was a solo mission (built it, broke it, fixed it, cried, and survived)  
- the other was a team project (aka “let’s all code and hope for the best”)

but… you won’t find them here yet  
because I refuse to upload anything that would roast me in public 😶‍🌫️

for now, this space is just *manifesting greatness*.  
my future self is working on it!
